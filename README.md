# Jungle Adventure: A Choose Your Own Adventure Game
#
# Hey! So this game is called "Jungle Adventure," and here's the deal:
# You survived a crazy plane crash and woke up in this super dense, spooky jungle. 
# It's packed with wild animals, mysterious temples, and all kinds of stuff that 
# could either help you or, well... totally ruin your day.
#
# Your mission? Just survive, bro. Make smart choices, find a way out, and maybe 
# discover some treasures along the way. Every choice you make will change what 
# happens next, and there are a bunch of different endings. Like, you could 
# become besties with a monkey, find a hidden stash of gold, or... not survive at all.
#
# Key Features:
# - Tons of decision points (you’ve got at least 10 big ones to make).
# - A bunch of cool story paths (20+ little moments that decide your fate).
# - Some endings are awesome, others... not so much. But hey, that’s life in the jungle.
# - You can save your game progress and come back later if you chicken out halfway through.
#
# How to Play:
# - Just run the game and read the story.
# - When you're asked to make a choice, type in the number of the option you want. Easy!
# - Example: If it says "1. Go left" or "2. Go right" and you type "1," you're going left.
#
# So yeah, give it a shot! Can you escape and live to tell the tale, or will the jungle get you? Let’s see!
